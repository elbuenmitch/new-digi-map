# SVG Shape Editor Test Results

## Summary
Tests have been designed to validate the core functionality of the SVG Shape Editor application. These tests cover various aspects from initialization to element creation, manipulation, and export functionality.

## Test Cases
The test suite includes 10 primary test cases:

1. **App initialization** - Verifies that all major components are properly initialized
2. **Element types configuration** - Checks that element type definitions have correct properties
3. **Canvas setup** - Validates canvas initialization and scale
4. **Element manager initialization** - Confirms element manager and its data structures
5. **Element creation** - Tests the creation of new elements with proper attributes
6. **Element selection** - Verifies the selection mechanism for single elements
7. **Element multi-selection** - Tests selecting multiple elements simultaneously
8. **Copy and paste functionality** - Validates that elements can be copied and pasted with proper properties
9. **Grid visibility** - Tests toggling grid visibility
10. **Settings functionality** - Checks canvas dimension updates work properly
11. **Export functionality** - Validates SVG export capabilities

| Export functionality         | ✅ Pass | SVG export produces valid markup                                 |

## Fixes Implemented

During the testing process, the following issues were identified and fixed:

1. **Duplicate Paste Issue** - Fixed by removing a duplicate keyboard event handler in canvas.js that was causing two paste operations to be triggered for a single keyboard shortcut
2. **Element Color Issue** - Fixed by ensuring the element color is properly inherited from the app's elementTypes configuration during creation
3. **Element ID Display** - Fixed by adding proper DOM elements for displaying the element ID when the showName property is true

## Recommendations

Based on the test results, we recommend:

1. **Automated Testing** - Implement a more comprehensive automated testing framework for regression testing
2. **Unit Tests** - Add specific unit tests for each component to ensure modular stability
3. **Browser Compatibility** - Test the application across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior
